            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>When he is not cartooning, training wombats in jui jitsu, or hibernating for winter,
              Greg Bishop works a veterinarian in San Diego, California. Although raised by wild
              cassowaries in New Guinea, he has acclimated to human society and is usually quite
              docile. In fact, he has never attempted an unprovoked attack on a non-sibling.</p>

            <p>Because he loves animals, he has real life experience as: a zookeeper and tour
              guide at the San Diego Zoo, field researcher in the Amazon jungle, assistant at
              the Natural History Museum, marine mammal stranding response coordinator, equine
              gastrointestinal waste specialist at a horse hospital (i.e. pooper scooper),
              and even as a caretaker for tank full of anemones and bivalves in an undergrad
              biology class. As a veterinarian, Greg has worked on animals of all sizes and
              shapes, ranging from elephant shrews to shrewd elephants.</p>

            <p>He studied ecology at UC Davis before going to vet school and is well known
              (among his former college roommates) for illustrating a cartoon about squirrels
              for the student newspaper (check out <a href="#nuts_cartoons">Nuts</a>
              in the <a href="#links">links</a> page). Leading scientists disagree
              about the exact origin of his cartooning, but they generally conclude that
              he began at an early age, with critically acclaimed (if not commercially
              successful) series such as The Turtle Avenger, Sentient Vegetables In the
              Big City, and The Meaty Adventures of Corn Dog and Bacon Boy. His parents
              might have some copies in their garage somewhere.</p>

            <p>As stated above, Greg lives in San Diego. He likes surfing and burritos,
              usually in quick succession. So does his dog, Waffles. Other reported
              hobbies include bird-watching, painting, 80â€™s hair metal, trying to
              learn to weld, podcasts about history, and a little dabbling in theoretical
              physics. Greg wants YOUR NAME HERE to enjoy Fauna cartoons, so please
              leave some feedback. Please!</p>
