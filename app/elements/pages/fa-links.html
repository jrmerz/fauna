            <p>Greetings animal lovers! So I've taken quite a break from Fauna because I've been working on a really cool 
            project. I illustrated a children's book! Don't worry, you'll get your animal drawing fix because it's about 
            an adorable little elephant named Louie who has some great adventures.</p>
            <p>You can check it out on the website here: <a href="https://louieslittlelessons.com">https://louieslittlelessons.com</a></p>
            <p>Thanks everyone for your support and for sharing it if you dig it! Hope to be back with some new cartoons soon.</p>

            <p>Here is a cartoon strip I did for the UC Davis student newspaper when I was a senior in college. The main themes
            are squirrels and churros, which is I guess what I thought about most in college. </p>

            <h4><a href="http://www.sdzsafaripark.org/">San Diego Zoo Safari Park</a></h4>
            <p>Great park that takes exceptional care of their animals. Incredible open-space exhibits where you can see herds
            of rhinos and giraffes. They also are involved in tons of important field research both locally and globally.
            What a spot!</p>

            <p>I love this place. I worked here as a volunteer with the herpetology department and went on a field trip with
            them to collect specimens. Stunning exhibits, and brilliant people doing great work in Southern California.</p>

            <p>I worked for this organization while in vet school. They manage a ton of cool projects in the Salish Sea (inland
            waters around Seattle and Vancouver). They’re a great group of people dedicated to a healthy ecosystem. Check out
            all the research they’ve done!</p>
